Official implementation of **NMR-Solver: Automated Molecular Structure Elucidation via Large-Scale Spectra Matching and Physics-Guided Fragment Optimization**

## Overview

The project corporates large-scale spectral matching with physics-guided fragment optimization, providing a powerful framework for automated molecular structure elucidation from 1H and 13C NMR spectra.

## Setup

### SimNMR-PubChem Database

The processed dataset and database index of the SimNMR-PubChem Database are available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yqj01/SimNMR-PubChem). Put them in the [database](database) directory.

### Models & Datasets

The pre-trained model weights and evaluation datasets can be downloaded on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16952024). Put them in the [model](model) and [data](data) directory.

### Docker

You can use our pre-built Docker image for easy setup and deployment:

```bash
# Pull the latest Docker image
docker pull yqjin/nmr_solver:0.0.1

# Run the container interactively
docker run -it --rm yqjin/nmr_solver:0.0.1

# Or run with volume mounting for your data
docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/your/data:/workspace/data yqjin/nmr_solver:0.0.1
```

This Docker image includes all necessary dependencies and pre-configured environment for running NMR-Solver.

## Usage

### Deploy Database

To deploy the SimNMR-PubChem Database, run the following command:

```bash
python src/faiss_server/server.py
```

Then update the server configuration in [config.yaml](src/faiss_server/config.yaml) to point to your server address.

### Run Demo

Change the configuration file in `config/demo.yaml` as needed.

For running the algorithm, use the following command:

```bash
sh scripts/run.sh demo
```

For evaluation, use:

```bash
sh scripts/eval.sh demo
```
